# Rainforest

This is an attempt to make an easy on the eyes dark syntax highlighting theme with earthy colors for Kate.

To install go to the "Font & Color Schemas" section of the Kate Settings menu and import rainforest.kateschema. 

Please don't hesitate to suggest any improvements you would like to see.
